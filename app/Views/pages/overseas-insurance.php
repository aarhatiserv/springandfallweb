                    <p>International student health insurance is for students want to study abroad or who are studying
                        in a countries other than their own.It offers protection on a daily or monthly basis (with a
                        monthly payment option) that fulfills many school and government standards, and it is generally
                        available to students on J1 and F1 visas (like those on OPT).</p>
                    <p>There are three forms of international student insurance: -</p>
                    <p>1. Health Insurance for Students Studying Abroad -Student health insurance is designed
                        specifically for students studying outside of their native country, and International student
                        health plans offer a unique blend of advantages such as sports, mental health, and emergency
                        medical evacuation to give travel medical insurance while away from home. These plans also
                        provide coverage for the duration of a student's studies, allowing them to continue with the
                        same plan throughout their school.</p>
                    <p>2. Medical Insurance for Foreign Traveling Students - Travel medical insurance is intended to
                        accompany you on your trip overseas, and International Students' travel medical plans are
                        normally offered for fewer than two years and can be used as a stand-alone plan or as a
                        complement to existing major medical insurance. Additional trip coverage will be deemed
                        secondary insurance if you already have a fixed insurance solution, making it an ideal for
                        adding further benefits like emergency transportation. Additional out-of-pocket expenses that
                        your primary insurance may not cover can also be covered by travel choices.</p>
                    <p>3. Major Medical Insurance for Overseas Traveling Students - International medical insurance is a
                        long-term alternative that is available to students. International medical insurance, which is a
                        yearly renewable and extensive option, is designed primarily to provide coverage for expatriates
                        and anyone staying outside their home country for at least 12 months. These plans will most
                        probably be your only coverage, and they will include a variety of coverage levels and
                        deductibles for people as well as their entire families.</p>
