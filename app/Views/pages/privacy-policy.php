                (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval of the
                linking
                party and its products and/or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party’s site.</p>

            <p>We may consider and approve other link requests from the following types of organizations:</p>

                negative
                records
                with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of the hyperlink compensates the absence of Spring
                and
                Fall;
                and
                (d) the link is in the context of general resource information.</p>

            <p>These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b)
                does
                not
                falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval of the linking party and its products or services;
                and
                (c)
                fits
                within the context of the linking party’s site.</p>
